Project Brief: The Blue Team Arsenal
Context: "War Week" at Chanel Group

The Event: A high-stakes corporate competition between two employee teams.

The Theme: The Matrix.

The Team: The Blue Pill Team (The User).

The Objective: Build a "Home Base" web application that establishes team identity and dominance through a polished, high-tech aesthetic.

App Design Specification
1. The "Roster" Home Page

Structure: A centralized command center displaying a grid of 42 operatives.

Data Handling: The app must read from a JSON file that contains names, codenames, and descriptions. It must map these to locally stored image files.

The Operative Profile: Each operative needs an AI-generated "Zion Rebel" persona, including a one-word codename and a brief, gritty "backstory" consistent with the Matrix universe.

2. Visual Identity & UI (The Vibe)

Tone: Elite, clandestine, and futuristic.

Color Palette: Deep blacks and "Electric/Neon Blue" accents (distinguishing from the Red Team).

UI Elements: Use "Digital Rain" motifs, terminal-style fonts (Monospace), and glowing borders. It should look like a screen on the Nebuchadnezzar.

3. Core Functionality for the Agent to Build

Dynamic Rendering: Generate a responsive grid that can handle all 42 profiles without lag.

JSON-Driven Content: The interface will be rendered reflecting the contents of a JSON configuration file, which will be used as a CMS to update the roster.

The "Arsenal" Expansion: A framework that allows for future "AI vibes"—such as a strategy generator or a "glitch" detector—to be added as separate tabs.
